# pbuilder-config

This package sets up a machine for building debian packages with pbuilder/cowbuilder.
It is designed for jammy right now, so to build it we will use a jammy chroot.

You must have these packages installed:
```
sudo apt-get install pbuilder cowbuilder debmake debhelper
```

You must have a compatible pbuilderrc file, mine is [here](https://github.com/JordanJGarcia/configs/blob/master/pbuilder/pbuilderrc)
This should be modified after downloading pbuilder package.

First, ensure you have build dependencies installed:
```
sudo apt-get install gdebi
sudo gdebi debian/control
```

Then create a Jammy chroot (this could take a while):
```
sudo DIST=<pick a dist> pbuilder create
sudo DIST=<same dist> cowbuilder create
```

Then you can build the package like so:
```
DIST=<same dist> debmake --tar --yes --invoke 'pdebuild --pbuilder cowbuilder'
```

It will be placed in $BUILDRESULT as defined in your pbuilderrc, and you can install it onto
your machine directly from there.
